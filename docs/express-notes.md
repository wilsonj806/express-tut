## What is Express

Express is a lightweight, unopinionated web framework for use with Node.js. It was built as a back-end/ server-side framework to be used in conjunction with front-end/ client-side framework for a full-stack app.

- unopinionated, meaning that Express doesn't have guidelines/ requirements for how you code your applications
  - Redux for example is an opinionated framework
  - as Express is unopinionated, this allows the user freedom to plan and script out their application however they like
  - in addition it means that Express is lightweight as mentioned above, as you don't need the additional scripting required for an opinionated framework
    - error catching, code checking to make sure stuff is being done a particular way, etc

## Why use Express

- It makes building web applications with Node.js **much** faster/ easier
- Can be used for both server rendered apps(polymorphic apps) as well as API/ Microservices
- Full control of request and response
- Light, fast, free
- It's more JavaScript
