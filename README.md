## General Description

A quick Express.js tutorial with notes and etc.

Notes based off of Traversy Media's [Express crash course](https://youtu.be/L72fhGm1tfE)

Additional notes can be found in the [docs section](./docs/express-notes.md)

Also note that this tutorial/ crash course goes through both server-side APIs and server-side rendering. Normally you'd have one or the other but not both at once.

## Install

This tutorial uses Postman for API development, NPM, Git, and Node.JS.
